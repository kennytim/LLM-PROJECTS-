# ðŸ“š PDF Retrieval QA with LangChain + FAISS + OpenAI

This project demonstrates how to build a **retrieval-based question answering system** using:
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)  
- [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) (Facebook AI Similarity Search)  
- [OpenAI Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)

It allows you to:
1. Load and embed PDF documents.
2. Store the embeddings locally using FAISS.
3. Retrieve relevant chunks of text based on user queries.
4. Ask questions and get answers directly from your documents.
