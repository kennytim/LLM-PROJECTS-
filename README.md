This repository is a collection of projects I’m building with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
It serves as both a learning journey and a showcase of practical applications of LangChain, OpenAI, FAISS, and related AI tools.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. [📚 PDF Retrieval QA](./pdf-retrieval-qa)
A **question-answering system** that allows querying PDF documents using:
- **LangChain** for pipeline orchestration  
- **OpenAI embeddings** for vectorization  
- **FAISS** for efficient vector search  

**Features:**  
✔️ Load PDFs and split into chunks  
✔️ Store embeddings locally (FAISS)  
✔️ Perform similarity or MMR retrieval  
✔️ Ask natural-language questions and get answers
